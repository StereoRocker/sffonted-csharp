# Small Font Format editor

This tool implements a font editor for the [Small Font Format](https://www.stereorocker.co.uk/small-font-format/). It has been written in C#/WinForms/.Net 4.0 and, while untested, should work under Mono for non-Windows platforms.

Expect to see this project replaced by one which is truly portable between platforms in the future.
